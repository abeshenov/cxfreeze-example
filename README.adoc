= Simple example of cx_Freeze

- link:app.py[`app.py`] is an example app which uses extra packages
(`numpy` in this case).

- link:requirements.txt[`requirements.txt`] contains a list of dependencies, including `cx_Freeze`.

- link:Dockerfile[`Dockerfile`] builds an executable with `cxfreeze`.

To do that manually, first run

[source, bash]
----
pip install --no-cache-dir --requirement requirements.txt
----

Then

[source, bash]
----
cxfreeze app.py
----

The result is a folder `build/exe.linux-x86_64-<Python-version>/`.
It contains an executable binary `app` and a lot of dependencies in the `lib` dir.
